# Comparisons in JavaScript

## Learning Goals

- Identify equality operators
- Compare numbers using relational operators

## Introduction

Now that we know what _Boolean expressions_ are we'll start learning how to
create them. In this lesson we'll learn about comparison operators, which enable
us to check to see if a value is what we're expecting. Follow along with the
examples below in [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/javascript).

**Note:** JavaScript includes both _strict_ and _loose_ comparison operators.
When writing JavaScript, you should strongly prefer the **strict** operators.

The reason for this is the loose operators will return true even if the data
types aren't the same, which can result in unexpected behavior and bugs that can
be difficult to track down. Even if you find you need to compare two values of
different data types, you should avoid using loose operators. You will be better
off converting the data type of one of the variables so they have the same type,
then comparing them using a strict operator.

## Identify equality operators

JavaScript includes four equality operators:

- **strict equality operator** (`===`)
- **strict inequality operator** (`!==`)
- **loose equality operator** (`==`)
- **loose inequality operator** (`!=`)

These operators allow us to compare values and determine whether they are the
same.

### Strict Equality Operator `===` and Strict Inequality Operator `!==`

The **strict equality operator** returns `true` if two values are equal _without
performing type conversions_. Even if the values on both sides of the operator
look similar (e.g., `'42' === 42`), the `===` operator will only return `true`
if the data types also match:

```js
42 === 42;
// => true

42 === "42";
// => false

true === 1;
// => false

"0" === false;
// => false

null === undefined;
// => false

" " === 0;
// => false
```

This is logical and accurate!

The **strict inequality operator** returns `true` if two values are _not_ equal
_without_ performing type conversions:

```js
9000 !== 9001
// => true

9001 !== '9001'
// => true

[] !== ''
// => true
```

**_You should prefer `===` and `!==` for comparisons_**.

### Loose Equality Operator `==` and Loose Inequality Operator `!=`

The **loose equality operator** returns `true` if two values are equal:

```js
42 == 42;
// => true
```

However, it will _also_ return `true` if it can perform a type conversion (e.g.,
changing the string `'42'` into the number `42`) that makes the two values
equal:

```js
42 == "42";
// => true

true == 1;
// => true

"0" == false;
// => true

null == undefined;
// => true

" " == 0;
// => true
```

The **loose inequality operator** is the opposite of `==`. It returns `true` if
two values are _not_ equal, performing type conversions as necessary:

```js
9000 != 9001
// => true

9001 != '9001'
// => false

[] != ''
// => false
```

This is confusing and inaccurate! It makes no sense that the string `'0'` is
equal to the boolean `false` or that `null` and `undefined` — two **completely
different** data types — are equivalent.

**_You should prefer `===` and `!==` for comparisons_**. There are [a lot of
rules][equality table] that JavaScript follows when performing type coercion
using the `==` operator, and it's not worth keeping track of them all.

## Compare Numbers with Relational Operators

JavaScript includes four relational operators:

- **greater than** (`>`)
- **greater than or equals** (`>=`)
- **less than** (`<`)
- **less than or equals** (`<=`)

The behavior of these operators is consistent with the meaning of the
corresponding symbols in mathematics:

```js
88 > 9;
// => true

88 >= 88;
// => true

88 < 9;
// => false
```

However, beware of type conversion when comparing non-numbers against numbers.
For instance, when a string is compared with a number, the JavaScript engine
tries to convert the string to a number:

```js
88 > "9";
// => true
```

If the engine can't convert the string into a number, the comparison will always
return `false`:

```js
88 >= "hello";
// => false

88 <= "hello";
// => false
```

Strings are compared with other strings lexicographically, meaning
character-by-character from left-to-right. The following returns `false` because
the Unicode value of `8`, the first character in `88`, is less than the Unicode
value of `9`.

```js
"88" > "9";
// => false
```

If you aren't sure what data type you are going to be receiving, but you still
need to compare them, make sure that you tell JavaScript to [convert the string
to a number
first](https://gomakethings.com/converting-strings-to-numbers-with-vanilla-javascript/),
and then compare.

> **Top Tip**: Stick to comparing _numerical_ values with the relational
> operators and you'll be golden.

## Conclusion

JavaScript contains both equality and relational operators that we can use in
writing code to compare two values. The resulting statements are _Boolean
expressions_ — they always return `true` or `false`.

Make sure you're using the strict equality operators whenever possible, and only
comparing numerical values using the relational operators, and you'll avoid
annoying errors that can be time consuming to troubleshoot!
